# C-Indexer-WordLocations
C Program that can read through large text files and generate indexing for words within a text document.

The program organizes words alphabetically in the generated file, listing the frequency the word is used (word count) and the locations in which the word can be found (Page and Line).

The program user can define the words per line and the lines per page. Any changes in these settings will require that the text file be ran through the program again to update the changes in page and line dimensions.
